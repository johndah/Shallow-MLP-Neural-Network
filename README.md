# Shallow-Neural-MLP-Network
Shallow multilayer perceptron with clear visualization for classification and time series prediction

The project contains two implementations of the shalllow neural MLP network;

##Simple classification of linearly non-seperable data clusters:

Which successfully classifies by seperating clusters with a multidimentional sigmoidal function. The learning curve is presented below.

##Prediction of the chaotic time series:
The final regression of training and test data, respectively:
